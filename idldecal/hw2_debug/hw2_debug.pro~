;Debugging Homework


;Procedure that is trying print each element of a array from 1-10
pro error1
   x = findgen(10)
   for i = 0, n_elements(x) do begin
       print, x[i] ; comma next to print was missing
   endfor           ; Endfor was missing a 'o'
end


; Procedure that prints "hello"
pro error2 ; Mispelled 'pro'
  print, 'hello'   ; Mispelled 'print', and hello need to be a string and was missing quotes
end


; function that returns ' ed is a girl?'
pro error3 ; replaced function with pro because value is being printed, instead of returning.
a='ed '
b=' is '
c=' a girl?'
result=a+b+c ; 'd' variable was not defined.
print, result
end

; Combine two arrays into one
pro error4
   x = [1,2,3]
   y = ['a','b','c']
   z = list(x,y)

   print, z ; procedure didn't print anything so added the print line

end



pro error5
  x=findgen(100,100)
  s=size(x)
  for i=0,s[1] do begin
      
      for j=0,s[2] do begin
      
         if i+j eq 90 then begin ; replace '=' to 'eq'
         
            x[i,j]=0 ; The bracket after j is backwards
           
         endif
     
      endfor
   
   endfor                       ;Changed 'end' to 'endfor'

   for i=0,s[1]-1 do begin
      
      for j=0,s[2]-1 do begin
      
         if i+j>45 then begin
         
            x[i,j]=i+j
         
         endif
      
      endfor
     
      print,x
   
   endfor                       ; the for statement was never ended
