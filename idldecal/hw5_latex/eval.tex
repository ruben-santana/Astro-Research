%Abstract portion
\begin{abstract}
I really enjoyed the class! You guys did a great job explaing each topic clearly. The homeworks and workshops related to the lecture which made learning how to code really intuitive. Some ideas for improvement are updating the textbook to include a bit of python and latex in the end, and posting solutions to homeworks and workshops earlier.
\end{abstract}

%Pros of Class
\section{The Good}
Homeworks were fun and insightful.
Lectures were comprehensive.
Having the option to do anything for final project is amazing!

%Cons of Class
\section{The Bad}
Writing on white board was sometimes hard to read.
Homeworks took to long to be graded.
Should post solutions to homework and should edit parts of textbook, (Examples:Adding psym for histograms, LATEX, Python.)

%Math Example: Writing Euler-Lagrange equation
\section{The Math}
\begin{equation}
\sum_{j=0}^{n}
(-1)^{j}
\partial ^{j} _{\mu _1 \dots \mu _j}
\left(\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial\fint_{i,\mu _1 \dots \mu _j}} \right) = 0
\end{equation}


$\mu _1\dots\mu _j$ changes with j. For example first term will be $\mu _1$, second term will be $\mu _2$, third term will have $\mu _3$, and so on until the jth term.

%Making a Table
\section{The Tables}
\begin{table}[H]
  \begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
    \hline
    Food & Color\\
    \hline
    Tacos & Burgundy \\
    Burgers & Light Blue  \\
    Enchiladas & Purple
    \tabularnewline
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
  \caption{Food is Good, Colors are Wavelengths.}
  \label{tab:foodcolor}
\end{table}
