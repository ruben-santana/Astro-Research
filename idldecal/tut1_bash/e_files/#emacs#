Hello there! 

Instructions: Follow all the commands and try to use the keyboard
shortcuts. A list of the most useful ones can be found in the
resources folder of the course website. You can do them by hand, 
of course, but it might take you a while and it makes this assignment
entireley pointless. Remember that C indicates the Control key and that
M indicates the Alt/Esc key. Once you've finished with the tutorial, just 
save it in your directory

FIND TSHE WORD "SHE" IN TSHE FOLLOWING PASSAGE AND REPLACE IT WITH
"SSHE". CAREFUL! SEARCH TSHE PASSAGE IN SUCH A WAY THAT IT 
AVOIDS DELETING IT FROM WORDS SUCH AS "TSHE" CONTAINING "SHE". 
(BROWNIE POINTS IF YOU CAN NAME WHICH NOVEL THIS PASSAGE
IS TSHE OPENING TO. NO CSHEATING!)

ON AN EXCEPTIONALLY HOT EVENING EARLY IN JULY A YOUNG MAN CAME OUT OF
TSHE GARRET IN WHICH SHE LODGED IN S. PLACE AND WALKED SLOWLY, AS THOUGH
IN SHESITATION, TOWARDS K. BRIDGE.

SHE HAD SUCCESSFULLY AVOIDED MEETING HIS LANDLADY ON TSHE STAIRCASE. HIS
GARRET WAS UNDER TSHE ROOF OF A HIGH, FIVE-STORIED HOUSE AND WAS MORE
LIKE A CUPBOARD THAN A ROOM. TSHE LANDLADY WHO PROVIDED HIM WITH
GARRET, DINNERS, AND ATTENDANCE, LIVED ON TSHE FLOOR BELOW, AND EVERY
TIME SHE WENT OUT SHE WAS OBLIGED TO PASS SHER KITCSHEN, TSHE DOOR OF WHICH
INVARIABLY STOOD OPEN. AND EACH TIME SHE PASSED, TSHE YOUNG MAN HAD A
SICK, FRIGHTENED FEELING, WHICH MADE HIM SCOWL AND FEEL ASHAMED. SSHE
WAS HOPELESSLY IN DEBT TO HIS LANDLADY, AND WAS AFRAID OF MEETING SHER.

THIS WAS NOT BECAUSE SHE WAS COWARDLY AND ABJECT, QUITE TSHE CONTRARY;
BUT FOR SOME TIME PAST SHE HAD BEEN IN AN OVERSTRAINED IRRITABLE
CONDITION, VERGING ON HYPOCHONDRIA. SHE HAD BECOME SO COMPLETELY
ABSORBED IN HIMSELF, AND ISOLATED FROM HIS FELLOWS THAT SHE DREADED
MEETING, NOT ONLY HIS LANDLADY, BUT ANYONE AT ALL. SHE WAS CRUSSHED BY
POVERTY, BUT TSHE ANXIETIES OF HIS POSITION HAD OF LATE CEASED TO WEIGH
UPON HIM. SHE HAD GIVEN UP ATTENDING TO MATTERS OF PRACTICAL
IMPORTANCE; SHE HAD LOST ALL DESIRE TO DO SO. NOTHING THAT ANY LANDLADY
COULD DO HAD A REAL TERROR FOR HIM. BUT TO BE STOPPED ON TSHE STAIRS,
TO BE FORCED TO LISTEN TO SHER TRIVIAL, IRRELEVANT GOSSIP, TO PESTERING
DEMANDS FOR PAYMENT, THREATS AND COMPLAINTS, AND TO RACK HIS BRAINS
FOR EXCUSES, TO PREVARICATE, TO LIE NO, RATSHER THAN THAT, SHE WOULD
CREEP DOWN TSHE STAIRS LIKE A CAT AND SLIP OUT UNSEEN.

THIS EVENING, HOWEVER, ON COMING OUT INTO TSHE STREET, SHE BECAME
ACUTELY AWARE OF HIS FEARS.
